## Hi there! 👋🏻

Hi there! I’m Layna. I am a writer, artist and a mom. I immigrated to the USA in 2014. Now, living in West Virginia, I’m a mix of curious explorer and laid-back mom. Yay, "Let's Go Mountaineers! 💓".

I am a woman who’s learned that life has its twists, turns, and a few fun detours 😉. With my boys grown and mostly out of the house, I finally have time for some of my own passion “projects” (the kind I don’t talk about with my Bible study companions).

This site is my little corner where I get to share my art, my stories, and maybe even stir a bit of mystery for anyone who’s curious enough to look.
