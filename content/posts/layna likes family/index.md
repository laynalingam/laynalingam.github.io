## I love my fam 👩🏼‍👧‍👦,

I love my family. Since, my ex-husband divorced me three years ago, I am flying solo. Living with my two cubs 🐯, I wouldn't say it was half as bad as I expected.

Motherhood has been its own wild adventure! My two boys are adults now, and while I’m so proud of them, sometimes this house can feel like a bit of a zoo 🦁. Life as a single mom of two sometimes-rowdy young men has its challenges—and its surprises. As they’ve grown older, let’s just say they’re not as bashful about exploring their own lives, interests, and impulses, which can make for some… interesting family dynamics.

Rediscovering myself while living with two young men who are often a little too comfortable with themselves has been… interesting. Let’s just say, life as a single mom has some surprises. Like every morning finding sticky wet crumbled napkins while cleaning their rooms or catching a glimpse of their screens before they realize I’m there.

Anyway, after my divorce, I have my own frustrations and, well, let’s call them “needs” that I’m rediscovering as I carve out more of my space.
