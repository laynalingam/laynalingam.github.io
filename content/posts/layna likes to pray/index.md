## My Faith ⛪

I am a good Christian.

I believe Jesus Christ is our lord and savior. Faith is a grounding force in my life, and I’m a regular at our local Bible study group, where I’m known for a bit of… creative interpretation 📖.

I believe in devotion, reflection, and a little room for wandering spiritual thoughts—who doesn’t? I find faith isn’t always so black and white, and if you read between the lines, you might catch a bit of my own personal passion woven in. After all, life and faith can hold more than meets the eye. I also love to irritate my sons coaxing them to read Bible 😉.

Faith and fantasy often coexist in unique, mysterious ways.
